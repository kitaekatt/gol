# Task: Environment Setup
## Status: COMPLETED
## Completed By: Bevy Mode
## Completion Date: 2025-07-16
## Test Results: 
- Rust toolchain: rustc 1.88.0 (6b00bc388 2025-06-23)
- Cargo package manager: cargo 1.88.0 (873a06493 2025-05-10)
- Protocol Buffer compiler: libprotoc 3.21.12
- Bevy project builds successfully with warnings only
- Console client builds successfully with warnings only
- Basic Cargo functionality validated
## Files Modified: None (verification only)
## Runtime Validation: Both Bevy and Console client projects compile successfully

## Description
Install and configure the Rust/Cargo development environment required for building and testing the Bevy implementation and Console client. This is the critical blocker preventing any validation of existing code.

## Requirements
- Install Rust toolchain with latest stable version
- Verify Cargo package manager is working
- Confirm ability to build Rust projects
- Validate Protocol Buffer compilation support

## Implementation Notes
- Use official Rust installer (rustup) for cross-platform compatibility
- Ensure all required dependencies are available
- Test basic Cargo functionality before proceeding
- Check for any WSL-specific configuration needs

## Validation
- `rustc --version` returns valid version
- `cargo --version` returns valid version
- `cargo new test_project && cd test_project && cargo build` succeeds
- Protocol Buffer compilation tools available

## Agent Instructions
- This is a project-level task that requires user coordination
- Should be handled by Default mode with user permission for installations
- Do not proceed with implementation tasks until environment is confirmed working
- Document any environment-specific configuration needed

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] Rust toolchain installed and working
- [ ] Cargo package manager functional
- [ ] Basic Rust project builds successfully
- [ ] Protocol Buffer tools available
- [ ] Environment ready for Bevy validation
- [ ] Environment ready for Console client validation

## Next Steps After Completion
1. Switch to Bevy mode to validate existing implementation
2. Switch to Console mode to validate existing client
3. Assess C++ environment for EnTT/Flecs implementations
