## Task Management System

### Task Structure
Each implementation directory contains a `tasks/` folder with individual `.md` files for specific work items:

```
{implementation}/tasks/
├── setup-project.md
├── implement-ecs-components.md
├── create-neighbor-system.md
├── implement-lifecycle-system.md
├── setup-http-server.md
├── create-api-endpoints.md
├── implement-pattern-loading.md
├── create-tests.md
└── optimize-performance.md
```

### Task File Format
Each task file follows this structure:
```markdown
# Task: [Task Name]

## Description
Brief description of the task and its purpose.

## Requirements
- Specific requirements from REQUIREMENTS.md
- Acceptance criteria
- Dependencies on other tasks

## Implementation Notes
