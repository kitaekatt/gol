# Create Implementation README Documentation

## Task Overview
**Priority**: High
**Assigned Mode**: Meta
**Created By**: Orchestrator coordination

## Objective
Create comprehensive README.md files for all four implementation directories to address documentation gaps identified during shutdown process and establish foundation for development work.

## Context
Shutdown process analysis revealed missing README files for:
- `gol-bevy/README.md`
- `gol-entt/README.md`
- `gol-flecs/README.md`
- `gol-console-client/README.md`

These README files are critical for:
- Development environment setup
- Architecture documentation
- Implementation-specific guidance
- Cross-implementation consistency

## Requirements

### README Structure Template
Each README should include:
1. **Implementation Overview** - ECS framework and approach
2. **Development Environment Setup** - Prerequisites and installation
3. **Architecture Summary** - ECS components and systems design
4. **Build Instructions** - How to compile and run
5. **Testing Guidelines** - How to run tests and validation
6. **API Documentation** - gRPC service interface
7. **Performance Targets** - Expected performance characteristics
8. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

### Framework-Specific Requirements

#### Bevy README (`gol-bevy/README.md`)
- Rust/Cargo setup instructions
- Bevy ECS architecture patterns
- Component and system organization
- Resource management approach
- gRPC server integration

#### EnTT README (`gol-entt/README.md`)
- C++ build system setup (CMake)
- EnTT ECS library usage
- Entity-component architecture
- System execution order
- gRPC server integration

#### Flecs README (`gol-flecs/README.md`)
- C++ build system setup (CMake)
- Flecs ECS framework usage
- Query and system design
- Module organization
- gRPC server integration

#### Console Client README (`gol-console-client/README.md`)
- Terminal client setup
- gRPC client configuration
- UI framework and controls
- Multi-server connectivity
- Visualization implementation

## Meta Mode Constraints
- Work exclusively within meta/ directory scope
- Write access to any directory with careful coordination
- Self-check before modifying files in other modes' directories
- End response with [Mode:Meta] declaration

## Expected Deliverables
- [ ] `gol-bevy/README.md` - Comprehensive Bevy implementation guide
- [ ] `gol-entt/README.md` - Comprehensive EnTT implementation guide
- [ ] `gol-flecs/README.md` - Comprehensive Flecs implementation guide
- [ ] `gol-console-client/README.md` - Comprehensive console client guide

## Acceptance Criteria
- All four README files created with consistent structure
- Each README provides complete setup and development guidance
- Architecture documentation aligns with ARCHITECTURE.md
- Framework-specific patterns and best practices documented
- Build and test instructions are clear and actionable

## Implementation Approach
1. **Review Existing Documentation** - Analyze ARCHITECTURE.md and REQUIREMENTS.md
2. **Create README Template** - Establish consistent structure
3. **Framework Research** - Document framework-specific patterns
4. **Implementation-Specific Content** - Create tailored content for each framework
5. **Validation** - Ensure consistency and completeness

## Notes
- This addresses critical documentation gaps identified in shutdown process
- Essential foundation for implementation agent development work
- Enables proper development environment setup
- Establishes consistent documentation standards across implementations

## Priority
**High** - Blocking development work until documentation foundation established

## Estimated Effort
**4-6 hours** - Research, writing, and validation for all four README files

## Dependencies
- Access to ARCHITECTURE.md and REQUIREMENTS.md
- Framework documentation research
- Understanding of gRPC integration patterns
- Consistent documentation structure template
