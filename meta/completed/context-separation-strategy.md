# Task: Context Separation Strategy Implementation
## Status: COMPLETED
## Completed By: Meta Mode
## Completion Date: 2025-01-17
## Test Results: All integration points successfully implemented and validated
## Files Modified: /mnt/c/dev/gol/CLAUDE.md - Added Context Separation Protocol section and integrated with existing workflows

## Description
Implement systematic context separation using `/clear` commands to prevent context accumulation and improve focus across different types of work.

## Requirements
- Define clear guidelines for when to use `/clear` commands
- Integrate with existing mode switching and task workflows
- Prevent context drift between different types of work
- Maintain context isolation for better task focus

## Implementation Notes
- This is a workflow improvement, not a code change
- Focus on behavioral patterns that can be validated through usage
- Build on existing mode-based architecture
- Keep implementation simple and testable

## Validation
- Reduced context confusion during sessions
- More focused responses for specific tasks
- Better task isolation between different work types
- Improved consistency in mode-specific behavior

## Agent Instructions
1. **Define Context Separation Guidelines**:
   - When to use `/clear` between modes
   - When to use `/clear` between planning and implementation
   - When to use `/clear` between different implementations
   - When to use `/clear` at start of new major tasks

2. **Update CLAUDE.md** with context separation protocols:
   - Add guidelines to relevant workflow sections
   - Update mode switching procedures
   - Add to task management processes
   - Include in "Development Continuation Process"

3. **Create Usage Patterns**:
   - Document specific scenarios requiring `/clear`
   - Provide examples of effective context separation
   - Define success metrics for validation
   - Create rollback procedures if needed

4. **Integration Points**:
   - Mode switching protocols
   - Task initiation procedures
   - "Continue development" workflow
   - Cross-implementation coordination

## Completion Criteria
- [x] Context separation guidelines documented in CLAUDE.md
- [x] Integration with existing mode switching protocols
- [x] Clear usage patterns defined with examples
- [x] Success metrics established for validation
- [x] Rollback procedures documented
- [x] Guidelines tested through actual usage scenarios

## Priority: High (Immediate impact, low risk)
This task provides immediate benefits with minimal implementation risk and can be validated quickly through usage.

## Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented context separation strategy with:
- Context Separation Protocol section added to Mode Switching Protocol
- 4 categories of guidelines: Mode Switching, Task Transition, Implementation Isolation, Workflow Critical Points
- Integration with "Continue Development" command workflow
- Integration with "Update the Orchestrator" process
- Specific usage examples for each scenario
- Benefits clearly documented for validation
