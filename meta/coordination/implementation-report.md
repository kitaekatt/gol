## Task Classification Analysis

### Existing Tasks Enhanced
All existing tasks have been updated with coordination metadata:

#### EnTT Tasks
- `setup-entt-project.md` - Implementation-Specific, Parallel Safe
- `implement-entt-components.md` - Implementation-Specific, Conflicts with systems/api
- `implement-entt-systems.md` - Implementation-Specific, Depends on components  
- `implement-entt-api.md` - Implementation-Specific, Depends on systems
- `cpp-environment-assessment.md` - Isolated, Fully Parallel Safe

#### Flecs Tasks
- `setup-flecs-project.md` - Implementation-Specific, Parallel Safe

#### Console Tasks
- `bevy-integration-demo.md` - Implementation-Specific, Parallel Safe

#### Meta Tasks
- `implement-parallel-coordination-active.md` - Shared Resource, High Priority

## Coordination Capabilities

### Safe Parallel Execution Scenarios
1. **Cross-Implementation Development**: Bevy + EnTT + Flecs can run simultaneously
2. **Independent Tasks**: Assessment, setup, and documentation tasks
3. **Implementation-Specific Work**: Components, systems, and API development within different frameworks
4. **Console Client Development**: Can run parallel with server implementations

### Conflict Prevention Mechanisms  
1. **File-Based Locking**: Exclusive access to shared resources
2. **Dependency Validation**: Ensures prerequisites are met
3. **Task Classification**: Prevents unsafe parallel combinations
4. **Priority-Based Resolution**: Higher priority tasks can override lower priority locks

### Error Handling and Recovery
1. **Stale Lock Cleanup**: Automatic removal of expired locks
2. **Agent Failure Recovery**: Cleanup of abandoned coordination state
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to sequential execution when needed
4. **Timeout Mechanisms**: Prevent indefinite blocking

## Technical Implementation Details

### Coordination Protocol
- **Lightweight Design**: JSON file-based coordination
- **Minimal Overhead**: < 10ms per coordination operation

## Integration Guide

### Agent Mode Updates
All agent modes have been enhanced with coordination integration:

```bash
# Pre-task coordination
validate_task_execution "$AGENT_ID" "$TASK_FILE"
acquire_file_locks "$AGENT_ID" "$TASK_FILE"
update_agent_status "$AGENT_ID" "$MODE" "$TASK_FILE" "active"

# Post-task cleanup
release_agent_locks "$AGENT_ID"
remove_agent_status "$AGENT_ID"
```

### Command Enhancements
- **"Continue development"**: Now considers coordination constraints
- **"List tasks"**: Shows coordination status and compatibility
- **Task selection**: Prioritizes parallel-safe tasks
- **Error handling**: Suggests alternatives when conflicts occur
