# Complete GitHub Upload

## Task Overview
**Priority**: High
**Assigned Mode**: Meta
**Created By**: Meta mode - extending setup-git-repository.md task

## Objective
Complete the git repository setup by guiding the user through GitHub repository creation and initial push to make the project publicly available.

## Context
The local git repository has been initialized but the task isn't complete until the project is uploaded to GitHub. The user needs guidance on creating a GitHub repository and pushing the local commits.

## Current Status
- Local git repository initialized
- .gitignore file created
- Initial commit ready to be made
- GitHub authentication needed for remote operations

## Requirements
1. Guide user through GitHub repository creation
2. Help configure remote origin
3. Assist with GitHub authentication setup
4. Guide through initial push to GitHub
5. Verify project is accessible on GitHub

## Agent Constraints
- Work exclusively within meta/ directory scope for task files
- Provide clear, step-by-step instructions to user
- Do not execute git commands directly - guide user through process
- End response with [Mode:Meta] declaration

## Expected Deliverables
1. GitHub repository creation instructions
2. Remote origin configuration steps
3. GitHub authentication setup guidance
4. Initial push instructions
5. Verification steps to confirm upload success

## Acceptance Criteria
- GitHub repository created successfully
- Local repository connected to GitHub remote
- Initial commit pushed to GitHub
- Project visible and accessible on GitHub
- User can continue development with proper git workflow

## Next Steps
1. Guide user through GitHub repository creation
2. Help set up authentication (GitHub CLI or SSH)
3. Configure remote origin
4. Push initial commit
5. Verify project is live on GitHub

## Notes
- User mentioned they have a GitHub account but haven't used it in WSL/Ubuntu
- Authentication will be needed for remote operations
- Consider recommending GitHub CLI for easier WSL integration
- Ensure proper repository visibility settings (public/private)
