# Evaluate Perplexity Research Enhancement Options

## Task Overview
Research and evaluate enhanced web search capabilities for Claude Code workflow, with strong preference for cost-effective solutions including free/self-hosted options.

## Context
Current web search capabilities are limited to basic queries. Perplexity-style research enhancement could significantly improve information quality, but cost is a primary concern. We prefer simplicity and low maintenance overhead.

## Requirements

### Primary Evaluation Criteria
1. **Cost Analysis** - Primary factor in decision making
2. **Quality of Research Results** - Improvement over basic WebSearch
3. **Setup Complexity** - Preference for simple, low-maintenance solutions
4. **Self-Hosted Viability** - Investigate free alternatives to paid services

### Research Areas

#### 1. Perplexity MCP Server Options
- **Official Perplexity API**: Cost structure, usage limits, pricing tiers
- **Alternative Perplexity MCP implementations**: Community versions, feature differences
- **Usage patterns**: Expected query volume for our workflow

#### 2. Self-Hosted Research Enhancement Options
- **Open-source search engines**: SearxNG, Whoogle, other privacy-focused options
- **Local RAG implementations**: Ollama + embedding models for document search
- **Hybrid approaches**: Free tier + fallback to basic search

#### 3. Free/Low-Cost Alternatives
- **Brave Search API**: Free tier availability, rate limits
- **DuckDuckGo API**: Available options, integration complexity
- **Academic search APIs**: arXiv, Semantic Scholar, other research-focused services
- **Multi-source aggregation**: Combining multiple free APIs

#### 4. Cost-Benefit Analysis
- **Perplexity API pricing**: Per-query costs, monthly limits
- **Self-hosted infrastructure**: Server costs, maintenance time
- **ROI calculation**: Value of enhanced research vs. implementation/operational costs

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Enhancement
- Improved research quality over basic WebSearch
- Cost-effective solution (free strongly preferred)
- Simple setup and maintenance
- Integration with existing Claude Code MCP architecture

### Evaluation Deliverables
1. **Cost comparison table** - All options with pricing breakdown
2. **Technical feasibility assessment** - Setup complexity, dependencies
3. **Quality comparison** - Research result improvement over baseline
4. **Implementation recommendation** - Preferred solution with rationale

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Research and Cost Analysis
- Document all available options with pricing
- Identify free/self-hosted alternatives
- Evaluate technical requirements for each option

### Phase 2: Proof of Concept Testing
- Test most promising free options
- Compare search quality against current WebSearch
- Assess setup complexity and maintenance requirements

### Phase 3: Recommendation and Implementation
- Provide cost-benefit analysis
- Recommend preferred solution
- Create implementation task if beneficial option identified

## Constraints and Preferences

### Strong Preferences
- **Free solutions** over paid services
- **Self-hosted** over vendor-dependent services
- **Simple setup** over feature-rich complexity
- **Low maintenance** over high-capability/high-maintenance

### Acceptable Trade-offs
- Slightly lower quality for significantly lower cost
- Some setup complexity for long-term cost savings
- Limited features if core research enhancement is achieved

## Acceptance Criteria

### Task Completion Requirements
- [x] Comprehensive cost analysis of all viable options
- [x] Technical feasibility assessment for top 3 candidates
- [x] Quality comparison testing results
- [x] Clear recommendation with cost-benefit rationale
- [x] Implementation plan for recommended solution (if any)

### Decision Framework
1. **Cost**: Free > Low-cost > Expensive (primary factor)
2. **Quality**: Significant improvement over baseline required
3. **Complexity**: Simple setup and maintenance strongly preferred
4. **Sustainability**: Long-term viability without ongoing costs

## Notes
- If no cost-effective enhancement is found, recommend continuing with current WebSearch
- Consider that our current research workflow may already be sufficient
- Evaluate whether the complexity cost outweighs the research quality benefit
- Document findings for future reference even if no implementation is recommended

## Priority
**Medium** - Research enhancement is valuable but not critical to core project success

## Estimated Effort
**4-6 hours** - Research, testing, and documentation

## Dependencies
- Access to various API documentation and pricing
- Ability to test self-hosted solutions in development environment
- Current WebSearch baseline for quality comparison

## TASK COMPLETED

**Completion Date**: 2024-07-17
**Results**: Detailed evaluation completed and documented in `perplexity-research-enhancement-evaluation.md`

**Key Findings**:
- **Recommendation**: Brave Search API as primary solution (2000 free queries/month)
- **Secondary Option**: SearxNG for self-hosted privacy-focused search
- **Cost Analysis**: Free tier covers typical usage, excellent ROI
- **Implementation**: Simple one-line MCP server installation

**Next Steps**: 
- Implement Brave Search API integration if research enhancement is approved
- Consider SearxNG deployment for high-volume or privacy-critical scenarios
