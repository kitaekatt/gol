# Implement Parallel Agent Coordination System - ACTIVE

## Task Overview
**Priority**: High
**Assigned Mode**: Meta
**Created By**: Orchestrator sub-task orchestration
**Status**: COMPLETED - Implementation delivered

## Objective
Implement a coordination system that allows multiple agents to work in parallel safely by understanding dependencies, file conflicts, and parallel execution opportunities.

## Context
This is the foundational task that enables all future parallel execution in the project. The orchestrator is delegating this work to the Meta agent while maintaining mode boundaries and providing full communication flow visibility.

## Requirements

### Phase 1: Task Metadata Enhancement
1. **Task Classification System**
   - Review all existing tasks across all implementations
   - Classify tasks as: Isolated, Implementation-Specific, Shared Resource, Sequential
   - Add metadata to task files: conflicts, dependencies, file modifications, parallel safety

2. **Task File Template Updates**
   - Create enhanced task file template with coordination metadata
   - Include: Conflicts With, Depends On, Modifies Files, Reads Files, Parallel Safe, Estimated Duration
   - Update existing task files with new metadata format

### Phase 2: Coordination Infrastructure
1. **Agent Status Tracking**
   - Create `meta/coordination/active-agents.json` for tracking current agent work
   - Include: current task, locked files, estimated completion, parallel compatibility
   - Implement status update protocol for agents

2. **File Lock Management**
   - Create `meta/coordination/file-locks.json` for lightweight file locking
   - Implement lock acquisition/release protocol
   - Add timeout mechanisms to prevent stale locks

3. **Conflict Detection System**
   - Implement logic to detect task conflicts before agent starts work
   - Create conflict resolution strategies (yield, queue, alternative task selection)
   - Add graceful degradation when conflicts occur

### Phase 3: Agent Intelligence Enhancement
1. **Smart Task Selection Logic**
   - Enhance agent task selection to consider active work by other agents
   - Implement priority adjustment based on parallel execution opportunities
   - Create fallback mechanisms when preferred tasks are blocked

2. **Coordination Protocol Integration**
   - Update agent mode templates to include coordination checks
   - Implement coordination status reporting
   - Add coordination cleanup protocols

## Agent Constraints
- Work exclusively within meta/ directory scope
- Full read/write access to meta/ directory
- Write access to any directory with careful coordination
- Self-check before modifying files in other modes' directories
- Escalate to orchestrator when cross-mode coordination needed
- End response with [Mode:Meta] declaration

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Task Classification Report**: Complete analysis of existing tasks with coordination metadata
2. **Coordination Infrastructure**: Working `meta/coordination/` system with active tracking
3. **Enhanced Task Templates**: Updated task file format with coordination metadata
4. **Agent Integration Guide**: Documentation for agents to use coordination system
5. **Testing Protocol**: Validation approach for parallel execution safety

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All existing tasks classified and enhanced with coordination metadata
- [ ] Coordination infrastructure files created and functional
- [ ] Agent task selection considers parallel execution safety
- [ ] File conflict detection prevents concurrent modifications
- [ ] Multiple agents can work safely in parallel on compatible tasks
- [ ] Coordination system handles agent failures gracefully
- [ ] Documentation updated with coordination protocols

## Technical Considerations
- **Lightweight Implementation**: Avoid complex locking mechanisms, use simple file-based coordination
- **Failure Handling**: Implement timeouts and cleanup for stale locks
- **Performance**: Minimize coordination overhead during normal operation
- **Scalability**: Design for future expansion beyond current 4 implementation agents
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing tasks continue to work during transition

## Communication Flow
```
1. ORCHESTRATOR SENDS PROMPT TO META AGENT:
   "You are operating in Meta Mode with coordination implementation task..."

2. EXECUTING SUBTASK:
   Task(Implement parallel coordination system)
   âŽ¿ [Meta agent analyzes requirements and implements coordination infrastructure]

3. ORCHESTRATOR RECEIVES SUBTASK RESPONSE:
   [Coordination system implementation with infrastructure and documentation]

4. ORCHESTRATOR ANALYSIS:
   [Orchestrator processes results and validates coordination system]

5. ORCHESTRATOR DECISION:
   [Enable parallel execution across project based on coordination system]
```

## Notes
- This task enables the foundational capability for all future parallel agent work
- Success of this task directly impacts project development efficiency
- Coordination system must be robust enough to handle agent failures gracefully
- Implementation should be lightweight to avoid impacting normal development flow
