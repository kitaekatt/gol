# Task: CLAUDE.md Modularization Implementation

## Description
Break the monolithic CLAUDE.md file (2000+ lines) into logical imports to reduce context bloat while preserving existing structure and functionality.

## Requirements
- Reduce main CLAUDE.md file to under 500 lines
- Maintain all existing functionality during transition
- Use Claude Code's import syntax (@path/to/file.md)
- Preserve existing mode switching and command recognition
- Enable easier navigation and maintenance

## Implementation Notes
- This is a structural change requiring careful testing
- Plan for gradual migration with rollback capability
- Test all mode switching and command recognition after changes
- Focus on logical separation without behavior changes

## Validation
- Main CLAUDE.md under 500 lines
- No behavior changes during transition
- All mode switching works correctly
- Command recognition remains functional
- Easier navigation and maintenance

## Agent Instructions
1. **Plan Modularization Structure**:
   - Identify logical sections for separation
   - Design import hierarchy for clarity
   - Plan transition sequence to minimize risk
   - Create rollback strategy

2. **Suggested Module Structure**:
   ```
   CLAUDE.md (Main Entry Point - <500 lines)
   ├── @meta/docs/commands.md           # User Commands Reference
   ├── @meta/docs/modes.md              # Operating Modes System  
   ├── @meta/docs/tasks.md              # Task Management System
   ├── @meta/docs/development.md        # Development Commands & QA
   ├── @meta/docs/project-structure.md  # Implementation Structure
   ```

3. **Implementation Approach**:
   - Create docs/ subdirectory in meta/
   - Extract logical sections into separate files
   - Update main CLAUDE.md with import statements
   - Test functionality after each module extraction
   - Validate all mode switching and commands

4. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Test all mode switching after modularization
   - Verify command recognition patterns work
   - Check that all documentation is still accessible
   - Validate workflow processes remain intact

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] Module structure planned and documented
- [ ] meta/docs/ directory created with logical modules
- [ ] Main CLAUDE.md reduced to under 500 lines
- [ ] All imports properly configured
- [ ] Mode switching tested and working
- [ ] Command recognition validated
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented and tested
- [ ] Documentation easier to navigate and maintain

## Priority: Future (Requires careful testing)
This task has high impact on maintainability but requires careful testing to ensure no behavioral changes occur during transition.
