# Task: Memory Maintenance Protocol Implementation

## Description
Implement systematic memory maintenance processes to prevent documentation drift and keep project documentation current, concise, and accurate.

## Requirements
- Integrate with existing Documentation Learning Protocol
- Add maintenance checkpoints to existing workflows
- Prevent documentation from becoming stale or inaccurate
- Keep documentation concise and relevant
- Build on existing task completion and orchestrator workflows

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on process improvements, not major structural changes
- Leverage existing workflow checkpoints for efficiency
- Emphasize regular review over comprehensive overhauls
- Design for incremental improvement over time

## Validation
- Reduced documentation drift incidents
- Faster onboarding for new tasks
- More consistent behavior across sessions
- Documentation that accurately reflects current project state

## Agent Instructions
1. **Define Maintenance Schedule**:
   - Weekly orchestrator reviews of key CLAUDE.md sections
   - Task completion documentation validation
   - Mode switching accuracy checks
   - Regular review of command patterns and workflows

2. **Update Existing Workflows**:
   - Add maintenance steps to "Update the Orchestrator" process
   - Include documentation validation in task completion
   - Add review checkpoints to mode switching
   - Update "Continue Development" to include maintenance

3. **Create Maintenance Procedures**:
   - Document review checklist for orchestrator
   - Process for identifying and fixing documentation drift
   - Guidelines for keeping documentation concise
   - Methods for validating documentation accuracy

4. **Integration Points**:
   - Task completion workflows
   - "Update the orchestrator" command
   - Mode switching protocols
   - Documentation Learning Protocol
   - Weekly orchestrator coordination

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] Maintenance schedule defined and documented
- [ ] Integration with existing workflows completed
- [ ] Maintenance procedures documented with checklists
- [ ] Review processes for documentation accuracy
- [ ] Guidelines for keeping documentation concise
- [ ] Success metrics for measuring improvement
- [ ] Rollback procedures if maintenance becomes overhead

## Priority: Medium (Builds on existing workflows)
This task enhances existing processes with low risk and provides incremental improvements to documentation quality.
