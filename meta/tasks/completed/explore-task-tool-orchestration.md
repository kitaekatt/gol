# Explore Task Tool Orchestration Capabilities

## Task Overview
**Priority**: High  
**Assigned Mode**: Orchestrator (Exception to normal protocol)  
**Context**: Evaluate Claude Code's Task tool for enhancing orchestration capabilities within our established mode system

## Background
The user has provided a comprehensive guide on Claude Code's Task tool orchestration capabilities. This task explores how to integrate these capabilities while maintaining our established mode system architecture.

## Objective
Evaluate and demonstrate Task tool integration with our mode system through practical examples that maintain mode boundaries while enhancing orchestration efficiency.

## Special Instructions
**EXCEPTION TO NORMAL PROTOCOL**: This task should be executed in Orchestrator mode rather than Meta mode, despite being located in meta/tasks/. This is a special case for evaluating orchestration capabilities.

## Key Requirements

### 1. Mode Compliance Testing
- Create sub-task prompts that explicitly operate within specific modes
- Ensure all sub-tasks maintain mode boundaries and constraints
- Verify sub-tasks end responses with [Mode:X] declarations
- Test escalation paths back to orchestrator

### 2. Integration Strategy Validation
- Demonstrate parallel research capabilities across implementations
- Show how Task tool enhances documentation coordination
- Validate that mode delegation remains primary for implementation work
- Prove sub-tasks complement rather than replace existing architecture

### 3. Practical Implementation Examples
- Create actual sub-task demonstrations for current project needs
- Show research tasks for Bevy, EnTT, Flecs implementations
- Demonstrate documentation coordination tasks
- Test quality assurance and validation sub-tasks

### 4. Workflow Enhancement Assessment
- Evaluate efficiency gains from parallel processing
- Assess context management improvements
- Analyze coordination overhead vs. benefits
- Recommend integration guidelines

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Demonstration Sub-Tasks**: 3-4 actual sub-task executions showing mode compliance
2. **Integration Assessment**: Analysis of how Task tool enhances orchestration
3. **Workflow Recommendations**: Guidelines for when/how to use Task tool vs. mode delegation
4. **Updated Documentation**: Recommendations for updating orchestration protocols

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Sub-tasks operate within specified modes with proper constraints
- [ ] Mode system architecture remains intact and respected
- [ ] Orchestration capabilities demonstrably enhanced
- [ ] Clear guidelines established for future Task tool usage
- [ ] Documentation updated with new orchestration patterns

## Notes
This exploration should validate that Task tool orchestration can enhance our capabilities while maintaining the disciplined mode system that ensures project organization and agent specialization.

## Task Completion
Upon completion, provide structured report to user and delete this task file per normal protocol.
