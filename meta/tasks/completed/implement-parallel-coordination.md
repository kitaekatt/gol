# Implement Parallel Agent Coordination System

## Task Overview
**Priority**: High
**Assigned Mode**: Meta
**Created By**: Orchestrator for parallel execution improvement

## Objective
Implement a coordination system that allows multiple agents to work in parallel safely by understanding dependencies, file conflicts, and parallel execution opportunities.

## Problem Statement
Current agent system lacks coordination mechanisms, leading to:
- File contention when multiple agents modify shared files
- Dependency conflicts when agents work on overlapping tasks
- Inefficient prioritization that doesn't consider parallel execution safety
- Risk of agents "stomping on each other" during concurrent work

## Requirements

### Phase 1: Task Metadata Enhancement
1. **Task Classification System**
   - Review all existing tasks across all implementations
   - Classify tasks as: Isolated, Implementation-Specific, Shared Resource, Sequential
   - Add metadata to task files: conflicts, dependencies, file modifications, parallel safety

2. **Task File Template Updates**
   - Create enhanced task file template with coordination metadata
   - Include: Conflicts With, Depends On, Modifies Files, Reads Files, Parallel Safe, Estimated Duration
   - Update existing task files with new metadata format

### Phase 2: Coordination Infrastructure
1. **Agent Status Tracking**
   - Create `meta/coordination/active-agents.json` for tracking current agent work
   - Include: current task, locked files, estimated completion, parallel compatibility
   - Implement status update protocol for agents

2. **File Lock Management**
   - Create `meta/coordination/file-locks.json` for lightweight file locking
   - Implement lock acquisition/release protocol
   - Add timeout mechanisms to prevent stale locks

3. **Conflict Detection System**
   - Implement logic to detect task conflicts before agent starts work
   - Create conflict resolution strategies (yield, queue, alternative task selection)
   - Add graceful degradation when conflicts occur

### Phase 3: Agent Intelligence Enhancement
1. **Smart Task Selection Logic**
   - Enhance agent task selection to consider active work by other agents
   - Implement priority adjustment based on parallel execution opportunities
   - Create fallback mechanisms when preferred tasks are blocked

2. **Coordination Protocol Integration**
   - Update agent mode templates to include coordination checks
   - Implement coordination status reporting
   - Add coordination cleanup protocols

## Implementation Details

### Task Metadata Schema
```markdown
# Enhanced Task File Format
**Conflicts With**: [task1.md, task2.md] - Tasks that can't run in parallel
**Depends On**: [prerequisite1.md, prerequisite2.md] - Required completed tasks
**Modifies Files**: [file1.ext, file2.ext] - Files this task will change
**Reads Files**: [file1.ext, file2.ext] - Files this task depends on
**Parallel Safe**: [true/false] - Can run alongside other tasks
**Estimated Duration**: [30min/2hr/1day] - Time estimate for resource planning
**Implementation Scope**: [isolated/implementation-specific/shared/sequential]
```

### Coordination File Schemas
```json
// meta/coordination/active-agents.json
{
  "bevy_agent": {
    "current_task": "implement-ecs-components.md",
    "files_locked": ["gol-bevy/src/components.rs"],
    "estimated_completion": "2024-XX-XX",
    "can_parallel_with": ["entt_agent", "flecs_agent"]
  }
}

// meta/coordination/file-locks.json
{
  "ARCHITECTURE.md": "locked_by_orchestrator_until_2024-XX-XX",
  "proto/game_of_life.proto": "available",
  "gol-bevy/src/lib.rs": "locked_by_bevy_agent"
}
```

### Agent Task Selection Algorithm
```
1. Load current agent coordination status
2. Get available tasks for current agent mode
3. Filter out tasks that conflict with currently active work
4. Apply priority scoring with parallel execution bonus
5. Select highest scoring available task
6. Update coordination status before starting work
7. Release coordination status upon completion
```

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Task Classification Report**: Complete analysis of existing tasks with coordination metadata
2. **Coordination Infrastructure**: Working `meta/coordination/` system with active tracking
3. **Enhanced Task Templates**: Updated task file format with coordination metadata
4. **Agent Integration Guide**: Documentation for agents to use coordination system
5. **Testing Protocol**: Validation approach for parallel execution safety

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All existing tasks classified and enhanced with coordination metadata
- [ ] Coordination infrastructure files created and functional
- [ ] Agent task selection considers parallel execution safety
- [ ] File conflict detection prevents concurrent modifications
- [ ] Multiple agents can work safely in parallel on compatible tasks
- [ ] Coordination system handles agent failures gracefully
- [ ] Documentation updated with coordination protocols

## Technical Considerations
- **Lightweight Implementation**: Avoid complex locking mechanisms, use simple file-based coordination
- **Failure Handling**: Implement timeouts and cleanup for stale locks
- **Performance**: Minimize coordination overhead during normal operation
- **Scalability**: Design for future expansion beyond current 4 implementation agents
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing tasks continue to work during transition

## Integration Points
- **CLAUDE.md**: Update with coordination protocol documentation
- **Mode Templates**: Integrate coordination checks into agent activation
- **Task Management**: Enhance task completion protocols with coordination cleanup
- **Documentation**: Update development process with parallel execution guidance

## Success Metrics
- **Parallel Execution Safety**: Zero file conflicts during concurrent agent work
- **Efficiency Improvement**: Reduced agent idle time due to better task selection
- **Coordination Overhead**: Minimal performance impact from coordination system
- **Reliability**: Robust handling of agent failures and coordination edge cases

## Notes
This system enables confident parallel agent deployment while maintaining safety and efficiency. The lightweight approach balances coordination benefits with implementation simplicity.
