# Setup Git Repository

## Task Overview
**Priority**: High
**Assigned Mode**: Meta
**Created By**: Orchestrator task delegation

## Objective
Guide the user through initializing this project as a git repository with proper configuration, ignoring unnecessary files, and making the initial commit.

## Context
The Game of Life multi-implementation project is currently not under version control. This task will establish git repository management to track development progress across all implementations.

## Requirements
1. Guide user through git repository initialization
2. Create appropriate .gitignore file for multi-language project
3. Configure git with proper settings if needed
4. Stage and commit initial project state
5. Provide guidance on future git workflow

## Agent Constraints
- Work exclusively within meta/ directory scope for task files
- Provide clear, step-by-step instructions to user
- Do not execute git commands directly - guide user through process
- End response with [Mode:Meta] declaration

## Expected Deliverables
1. Step-by-step git initialization instructions
2. Comprehensive .gitignore file
3. Initial commit with all current project files
4. Git workflow recommendations for future development

## Acceptance Criteria
- Git repository successfully initialized
- .gitignore properly configured for Rust, C++, and console client
- Initial commit contains all relevant project files
- User understands git workflow for continued development

## Notes
- Consider multi-language project structure (Rust, C++, console client)
- Include patterns for build artifacts, dependencies, and temporary files
- Ensure .claude/ directory handling is appropriate
- Document git workflow for future development sessions
