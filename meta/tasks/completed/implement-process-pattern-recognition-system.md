# Implement Process Pattern Recognition System

## Task Overview
**Priority**: High
**Assigned Mode**: Meta
**Created By**: Orchestrator based on workflow optimization insight
**Implementation Scope**: Cross-agent process intelligence

## Core Insight

The current system relies on **explicit commands** (reactive) rather than **process pattern recognition** (proactive). When a user says "work on something", an optimized agent should automatically recognize this as a pattern that triggers task analysis, rather than manually attempting to discover available work.

## Problem Statement

### Current State: Reactive Command Execution
- Agents respond to explicit commands ("analyze tasks")
- Manual process discovery leads to inefficiency
- Inconsistent workflow patterns across agents
- No standardized process vocabulary

### Desired State: Proactive Process Recognition
- Agents recognize implicit work patterns ("work on something" → task analysis process)
- Consistent process language across all agents
- Self-optimizing workflow selection
- Standardized process library with optimized patterns

## Requirements

### Phase 1: Process Pattern Research and Analysis
1. **Claude Code Best Practices Research**
   - Research Claude Code documentation for workflow optimization patterns
   - Identify common work patterns in AI-assisted development
   - Analyze successful Claude Code implementation strategies
   - Document industry best practices for AI workflow optimization

2. **Current Workflow Pattern Analysis**
   - Analyze existing agent workflows for common patterns
   - Identify inefficient manual processes that could be automated
   - Map user request types to optimal process responses
   - Document current process inconsistencies

### Phase 2: Process Pattern Library Development
1. **Consistent Process Language**
   - Define standardized terminology for common work patterns
   - Create process description templates
   - Establish process classification system (commands vs. patterns vs. workflows)
   - Document process trigger conditions and expected outcomes

2. **Common Process Catalog**
   - **Task Discovery Process**: "work on something" → task analysis script
   - **Environment Setup Process**: "set up X" → environment assessment workflow
   - **Implementation Process**: "implement Y" → requirement analysis → design → implementation
   - **Debugging Process**: "fix Z" → error analysis → root cause → solution
   - **Status Reporting Process**: "what's the status" → progress analysis → structured report

### Phase 3: Process Recognition Intelligence
1. **Pattern Recognition Framework**
   - Create process trigger detection system
   - Map user request patterns to optimal process responses
   - Implement process confidence scoring
   - Build fallback mechanisms for unrecognized patterns

2. **Self-Optimization Mechanisms**
   - Enable agents to recognize inefficient manual processes
   - Provide process upgrade recommendations
   - Track process effectiveness metrics
   - Implement continuous process improvement

## Implementation Strategy

### Process Pattern Detection Algorithm
```
1. Parse user request for intent and scope
2. Match against process pattern library
3. Apply process confidence scoring
4. Select optimal process or fallback to manual
5. Execute process with appropriate parameters
6. Track effectiveness for continuous improvement
```

### Process Library Structure
```markdown
# Process Pattern Library

## Process: Task Discovery
**Triggers**: "work on something", "what's next", "continue development"
**Pattern**: User seeks available work without explicit task specification
**Optimal Response**: Execute task analysis script for current agent mode
**Command**: `Bash(command="bash meta/scripts/analyze-agent-tasks.sh [mode]")`
**Confidence**: High (standardized across all agents)

## Process: Environment Assessment
**Triggers**: "set up", "prepare environment", "check setup"
**Pattern**: User needs environment validation before work begins
**Optimal Response**: Environment-specific assessment workflow
**Command**: Implementation-specific setup validation
**Confidence**: Medium (varies by implementation)

## Process: Status Reporting
**Triggers**: "what's the status", "progress report", "where are we"
**Pattern**: User seeks current project/task status
**Optimal Response**: Structured progress analysis and reporting
**Command**: Context-specific status gathering and formatting
**Confidence**: High (standardized reporting format)
```

### Agent Integration Framework
```
When agent receives user request:
1. Process Recognition: Identify if request matches known pattern
2. Process Selection: Choose optimal process or fallback to manual
3. Process Execution: Execute process with appropriate parameters
4. Process Learning: Track effectiveness and improve recognition
```
