### Secondary Recommendation: SearxNG Self-Hosted

**Use Case**: If privacy is paramount or heavy usage expected

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Deploy SearxNG via Docker
2. Configure domain and SSL
3. Install MCP server: `claude mcp add-json "searxng" '{"command":"uvx","args":["mcp-searxng"]}'`
4. Configure endpoint in Claude settings
5. Test and optimize engine selection

**Expected Cost**: $5-10/month for VPS hosting

### Hybrid Approach (Optional)

Combine multiple solutions for comprehensive coverage:
1. **Brave Search API** for general web search (free tier)
2. **Semantic Scholar API** for academic research (free)
3. **SearxNG** as backup/privacy option (self-hosted)

## ROI Analysis

### Brave Search API
- **Cost**: $0-36/year (assuming occasional overage)
- **Time Savings**: 2-3 hours/week from improved search quality
