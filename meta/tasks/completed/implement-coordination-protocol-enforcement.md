# Implement Coordination Protocol Enforcement

## Task Overview
**Priority**: High
**Assigned Mode**: Meta
**Created By**: Orchestrator (coordination failure response)

## Objective
Implement mandatory coordination protocol adherence and recovery procedures for future coordination failures.

## Context
Coordination protocol breakdown allowed agents to work without proper registration, creating risks of conflicts and work duplication. Need enforcement mechanisms to prevent future failures.

## Requirements
1. **Mandatory protocol adherence**: Ensure all agents follow coordination protocols
2. **Automatic enforcement**: Build enforcement into agent workflow
3. **Recovery procedures**: Define clear steps for coordination failure recovery
4. **Protocol validation**: Verify agents are properly coordinated before work begins

## Agent Constraints
- Work exclusively within meta/ directory scope
- Focus on protocol enforcement mechanisms
- Integrate with existing coordination system
- End response with [Mode:Meta] declaration

## Expected Deliverables
1. Mandatory coordination protocol enforcement system
2. Automatic agent registration validation
3. Coordination failure recovery procedures
4. Protocol compliance verification tools

## Acceptance Criteria
- All agents must register before beginning work
- Coordination failures are automatically detected
- Recovery procedures are clearly documented
- System prevents uncoordinated agent activity

## Notes
Focus on preventing future coordination protocol breakdowns through systematic enforcement.
