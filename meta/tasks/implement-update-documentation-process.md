# Implement Update Documentation Process

## Task Overview
**Priority**: HIGH
**Assigned Mode**: Meta
**Phase**: 4 (System Improvement)

## Objective
Design and implement a comprehensive "update documentation" process with command trigger separation, addressing the efficiency vs. documentation currency tension while improving overall system architecture.

## Context
Current documentation-first approach creates inefficiency through multiple file writes during sessions. Need to design a batch documentation update process that maintains documentation currency while optimizing for efficiency. Additionally, need to separate command triggers from process implementation for better system architecture.

## Key Requirements

### 1. Update Documentation Process Design
- **Batch Documentation Updates**: Single documentation update at session end capturing all learnings
- **Session Learning Capture**: Systematic collection of insights, improvements, and changes during session
- **Multi-File Coordination**: Handle updates across multiple documentation files efficiently
- **Change Tracking**: Track what changed and why during session for comprehensive updates

### 2. Command-Process Separation
- **Command Triggers**: Clear trigger methods for executing defined processes
- **Process Implementation**: Well-defined processes separate from their triggers
- **Systematic Review**: Audit all existing commands and separate triggers from processes
- **Consistent Architecture**: Ensure all commands result in execution of well-defined processes

### 3. JSON Formatting Strategy
- **Structure vs. Overhead**: Balance JSON formatting benefits with LLM processing efficiency
- **Avoid Deep Nesting**: Prevent deeply nested JSON that creates LLM processing overhead
- **Command Definition**: JSON format for command triggers and process definitions
- **Process Schema**: Standardized JSON schema for process documentation

### 4. System Elegance Review
- **Architecture Optimization**: Review all existing processes for elegance opportunities
- **Consistency Improvements**: Ensure consistent patterns across all commands and processes
- **Redundancy Elimination**: Remove duplicate or overlapping process definitions
- **Scalability Assessment**: Ensure system can handle additional commands and processes

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Process Design
1. **Design Update Documentation Process**
   - Define systematic learning capture during sessions
   - Create batch update workflow for session end
   - Design change tracking and categorization system
   - Plan integration with shutdown process

2. **Design Command-Process Architecture**
   - Create separation between command triggers and process implementation
   - Design JSON schema for command definitions
   - Plan process execution framework
   - Define consistency requirements

### Phase 2: System Review
1. **Audit Existing Commands**
   - Review all commands in meta/docs/commands.md
   - Identify current mixing of triggers and processes
   - Document separation requirements for each command
   - Plan migration strategy

2. **Evaluate JSON Formatting**
   - Test JSON formatting approaches for command definitions
   - Measure LLM processing overhead for different nesting levels
   - Design optimal JSON schema balancing structure and efficiency
   - Create formatting guidelines

### Phase 3: Implementation
1. **Implement Update Documentation Process**
   - Create update documentation command trigger
   - Implement batch documentation update process
   - Integrate with shutdown process
   - Test with session learning capture

2. **Implement Command-Process Separation**
   - Migrate existing commands to new architecture
   - Create JSON-based command and process definitions
   - Update documentation to reflect new system
   - Validate all commands work with new architecture

### Phase 4: System Optimization
1. **System Elegance Review**
   - Review all processes for optimization opportunities
   - Implement identified improvements
   - Ensure consistent patterns across system
   - Remove redundancies and improve scalability

2. **Validation and Documentation**
   - Test complete system with real workflows
   - Update all documentation to reflect new architecture
   - Create usage guidelines for new system
   - Validate efficiency improvements

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Update Documentation Process**
   - Defined process for batch documentation updates
   - Command trigger for update documentation
   - Integration with shutdown process
   - Session learning capture system

2. **Command-Process Architecture**
   - JSON schema for command definitions
   - Separated triggers and processes for all commands
   - Process execution framework
   - Migration documentation

3. **System Improvements**
   - Optimized process definitions
   - Consistent architecture patterns
   - Eliminated redundancies
   - Improved scalability

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with new architecture
   - Updated meta/docs/commands.md with new system
   - Updated meta/docs/modes.md with process integration
   - Usage guidelines and examples

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Update documentation process designed and implemented
- [ ] Command triggers separated from process implementations
- [ ] JSON formatting strategy implemented with optimal LLM efficiency
- [ ] All existing commands migrated to new architecture
- [ ] System elegance review completed with improvements implemented
- [ ] Shutdown process integrated with update documentation process
- [ ] All documentation updated to reflect new system
- [ ] System validated with real workflow testing
- [ ] Efficiency improvements measured and documented

## Agent Constraints
- Work exclusively within meta/ directory scope
- Focus on system architecture and process improvement
- Maintain backward compatibility during migration
- Document all changes and improvements

## Notes
This task addresses the fundamental tension between documentation currency and efficiency while improving overall system architecture. The goal is a more elegant, maintainable system that captures all session learnings efficiently.

Success means documentation stays current without inefficient multiple file writes, and all commands follow consistent, well-defined processes.
