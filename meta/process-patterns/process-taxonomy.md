# Process Pattern Taxonomy

## Classification System

### Process Types

#### 1. Commands
**Definition**: Explicit, immediate actions with clear intent
**Characteristics**:
- Direct user instruction
- Specific action required
- No ambiguity in intent
- Immediate execution expected

**Examples**:
- "commands" → Display command reference
- "list tasks" → Show available tasks
- "show status" → Display current progress

#### 2. Patterns
**Definition**: Implicit work requests requiring process selection
**Characteristics**:
- Indirect user instruction
- Multiple possible interpretations
- Require process recognition
- Agent must infer optimal action

**Examples**:
- "work on something" → Task discovery process
- "continue development" → Continue current development workflow
- "what's next" → Next step identification process

#### 3. Workflows
**Definition**: Multi-step processes combining commands and patterns
**Characteristics**:
- Sequential action chains
- Context-dependent execution
- Multiple tool invocations
- State management required

**Examples**:
- Environment setup → Check dependencies → Validate configuration → Report status
- Implementation workflow → Analyze requirements → Design → Code → Test → Document
- Debugging workflow → Identify issue → Analyze root cause → Implement fix → Validate

### Trigger Classification

#### 1. Direct Intent Triggers
**Definition**: Clear, unambiguous requests
**Confidence Level**: High
**Processing**: Direct command execution
**Examples**:
```
"show project status" → Execute status report
"list available tasks" → Execute task listing
"switch to bevy mode" → Execute mode switch
```

#### 2. Implicit Intent Triggers
**Definition**: Work requests without explicit specification
**Confidence Level**: Medium to High
**Processing**: Pattern recognition and process selection
**Examples**:
```
"work on something" → Task discovery pattern
"continue development" → Development continuation pattern
"what should I do" → Next action identification pattern
```

#### 3. Context-Dependent Triggers
**Definition**: Requests requiring context analysis
**Confidence Level**: Medium
**Processing**: Context evaluation and pattern matching
**Examples**:
```
"set up" → Environment setup (context: current mode)
"test this" → Testing workflow (context: current implementation)
"fix the issue" → Debugging workflow (context: current error state)
```

#### 4. Ambiguous Triggers
**Definition**: Unclear requests needing clarification
**Confidence Level**: Low
**Processing**: Clarification request and fallback
**Examples**:
```
"work on it" → Clarify: What specific work?
"make it better" → Clarify: What aspect needs improvement?
"do something" → Clarify: What type of action?
```

### Context Dependencies

#### 1. Mode-Specific Context
**Definition**: Process behavior depends on current agent mode
**Examples**:
- "continue development" in Bevy mode → Bevy-specific tasks
- "continue development" in Console mode → Console-specific tasks
- "set up environment" in EnTT mode → EnTT environment setup

#### 2. Project-Specific Context
**Definition**: Process behavior depends on project state
**Examples**:
- "run tests" → Different commands based on project type
- "build project" → Different build systems based on implementation
- "deploy" → Different deployment strategies based on project

#### 3. State-Dependent Context
**Definition**: Process behavior depends on current system state
**Examples**:
- "continue development" with no active tasks → Task discovery first
- "fix issue" with no identified issue → Issue identification first
- "test" with no code changes → No action needed

#### 4. User-Preference Context
**Definition**: Process behavior adapted to user preferences
**Examples**:
- Testing strategy preferences
- Code style preferences
- Documentation level preferences

### Confidence Scoring System

#### High Confidence (90-100%)
**Characteristics**:
- Clear trigger patterns
- Standardized optimal response
- Minimal context dependency
- Proven successful pattern

**Examples**:
- "work on something" → Task analysis script
- "list tasks" → Task listing command
- "switch to X mode" → Mode switching

#### Medium Confidence (70-89%)
**Characteristics**:
- Clear trigger patterns
- Multiple valid responses
- Context-dependent optimization
- Generally successful pattern

**Examples**:
- "set up environment" → Environment setup workflow
- "what's the status" → Status reporting process
- "continue development" → Development continuation

#### Low Confidence (50-69%)
**Characteristics**:
- Ambiguous trigger patterns
- Multiple possible interpretations
- High context dependency
- Requires user clarification

**Examples**:
- "work on it" → Clarification needed
- "make it better" → Scope clarification needed
- "do something" → Intent clarification needed

#### No Confidence (0-49%)
**Characteristics**:
- Unclear or unknown triggers
- No recognized patterns
- Fallback to manual processing
- User guidance required

**Examples**:
- Novel or unique requests
- Typos or unclear phrasing
- Domain-specific jargon
- Incomplete requests

### Pattern Recognition Framework

#### 1. Trigger Detection Algorithm
```
Input: User request text
1. Parse request for keywords and intent indicators
2. Match against known trigger patterns
3. Evaluate context dependencies
4. Calculate confidence score
5. Select optimal process or fallback
Output: Process selection with confidence score
```

#### 2. Context Evaluation Framework
```
Input: Process selection + current context
1. Evaluate mode-specific constraints
2. Assess project-specific requirements
3. Check state-dependent conditions
4. Apply user preference adaptations
5. Validate process applicability
Output: Context-adapted process configuration
```

#### 3. Fallback Mechanism
```
Input: Low confidence process selection
1. Identify ambiguity sources
2. Generate clarification questions
3. Provide process options
4. Enable manual process selection
5. Learn from user feedback
Output: Clarified process or manual fallback
```
